Reaction time tests (or something like that), with C / Nuklear.

Mainly doing this to experiment with Nuklear, but I hope it gets to be useful in its own right!

## Build (and run)
1. `meson setup builddir/`
2. `meson compile -C builddir/`
3. `builddir/cognition`

I don't know if it works on Windows, but yeah. Also you'll need `glfw`.

## License
MIT.

Dependency licenses are in their respective directories in `ext/`.
